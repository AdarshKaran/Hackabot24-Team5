# Hackabot24-Team5
Check out the GitHub repo for Team 5's Teleoperated Extraterrestrial Rover from the University of Manchester HackABot2024 event.

# Challenge
Create a Teleoperated Extraterrestrial Rover for Completing a Series of Tasks. 

Within a 24-hour time limit, tasks included:

- Task 1: Teleoperating the robot to follow a designated path, maneuvering through diverse terrains such as sand, ramps, and bridges.
- Task 2: Remote operation of the robot using live camera data to contain and push ping-pong balls scattered across the arena into a central pit. Implemented color detection algorithms to identify the color of the ping-pong balls.
- Task 3: Conducting the final demonstration to exhibit the successful completion of all tasks and showcasing the innovations achieved within the allocated time frame at the University of Manchester's HackABot2024 event.
